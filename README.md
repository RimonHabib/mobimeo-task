#  Mobimeo Backend Task

- Create a service which provides a single API endpoint to search for GitHub users by the programming language they use in their public repositories (i.e. C, Java, Haskell)

- Each user returned in the response of the search request should at least contain the username, name, avatar url and number of followers.

- Use the GitHub APIs (https://developer.github.com/v3/) to retrieve the information. Use a Personal Access Token to avoid being rate limited

- The service should be developed with TypeScript. Feel free to use any libraries you find suitable for this task.

- The service should be covered with tests you find suitable for this task.

- Create a Dockerfile to run the service.

- Please use Git for this project.
